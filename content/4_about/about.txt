Friends Indeed Gallery is a mini-storefront and online shop offering works for sale by leading local and international contemporary artists. Our gallery borders San Francisco’s historic Chinatown and the Financial District. 

Through provocative exhibitions in our gallery, curated exhibitions online, and our fundraising program (launching March 2020), our aim is to bring community together through art. 

Friends Indeed Gallery is founded by curator-dealer Micki Meng with Eric Li and Nazlı Ercan.
