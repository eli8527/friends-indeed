Title: Laura Owens

----

Text: Laura Owens (b. 1970) has been acclaimed as one of the leading painters of her generation. Her was recently the subject of a mid-career retrospective at Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (2017-2018), which traveled to the Dallas Museum of Art (2018) and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (2018-2019), featuring some 60 paintings dating from the 1990s to the present. Over the course of her career, Owens has become recognized for her ranging and experimental approach to the medium of painting â€“ an approach that embraces a breadth of sources from the avant-garde to the populist to the decorative. Recent solo exhibitions include those at the CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts, San Francisco (2016); Secession, Vienna (2015); and Kunstmuseum Bonn, Germany (2011). Owens was born in Ohio and studied at California Institute of the Arts, Valencia, and Rhode Island School of Design, Providence. She lives and works in Los Angeles.
